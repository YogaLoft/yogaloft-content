## Jo and Nuku's Acroyoga Fundamentals Workshop Series

We have adapted (and improved!) our course structure to better suit everyone's needs ;-) 2 Sundays, 11-3pm £35 per day or £60 for both :-) 12th and 19th June at Plymouth Yoga Loft <3 

We have put together this two day course, which we will deliver on consecutive Sundays, designed to introduce the foundational building blocks of the beautiful practice of acroyoga. Come to one or both days, as they will progress and also stand alone ;-)

The sessions will enable you to develop strength and skills that you never knew you had, improve co-ordination, connect to and nourish the whole body, meet new people, make new friends and have a great deal of fun along the way. 

AcroYoga is a dynamic partner practice that blends the wisdom of yoga, the dynamic power of acrobatics, and the loving kindness of healing arts. These three lineages combined cultivate trust, playfulness, and community. 

The sessions will consist of:
Exercise drills to bring about integral body awareness and train new muscles. We will work on calibrations, play games to build strength and connection and safely develop the core principles of the acroyoga practice. 

There will be ample opportunity to exceed your own expectations as we explore and play with being upside down, touch on handstand basics, pops and counterbalances. 

The course will run over two consecutive Sundays from 11am to 3pm on the 12th and 19th of June. 
If you have been wondering how to get involved, this course is for you!

Course cost: One day £35, Both days £60
