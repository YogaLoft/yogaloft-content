## Jo and Nuku's Acroyoga Fundamentals Workshop Series

Early bird price available until Saturday 14th May. The course will be held over 4 consecutive Sundays.

We have put together a four week course designed to introduce the foundational building blocks of the beautiful practice of acroyoga. 

These progressive sessions will enable you to develop strength and skills that you never knew you had, improve co-ordination, connect to and nourish the whole body, meet new people, make new friends and have a great deal of fun along the way. 

The sessions will consist of:
Drills to bring about integral body awareness and train new muscles. We will work on callibrations, play games to build strength and connection and safely develop the core 
principles of the acroyoga practice.    

There will be ample opportunity to exceed your own expectations as we explore and play with being upside down, touch on handstand basics, pops and counterbalances. 

The course will run over four consecutive Sundays from 10am to 2pm beginning on the 12th of June. 
If you have been wondering how to get involved, this course is for you!
Bring a friend or come on your own.

Course cost: £125
Early Bird: £85 (bookings before the 14th of May)
