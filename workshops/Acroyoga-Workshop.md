## Intro to Yin Yoga
![flyer for acroyoga workshop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YogaLoft/yogaloft-content/master/workshops/georgie_yin.jpg "YinYoga")

Join Georgie as she guides you through this practice designed to bring you deeper than just the superficial muscles, accessing the connective tissues, mobilising joints and releasing fascia. You will explore the use of props as you allow the body to relax and let go of any stress and tension to feel fully supported in each pose. The workshop will introduce the use of pranayama and meditation to take you deeper, whilst learning the differences between a yin and yang, helping to better understand the benefits of a balanced practice.

Yin yoga is a quiet, meditative practice that uses long-held passive poses for 3-7 minutes with very little muscular engagement. A style you must experience to truly understand its benefits where you can expect to feel nourished and relaxed after this restorative workshop. 

This workshop is open to all levels and the perfect way to start your day leaving you energised for the rest of your day.
