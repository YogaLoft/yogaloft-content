Join Georgie as she guides you through this practice designed to bring you deeper than just the superficial muscles, accessing the connective tissues, mobilising joints and releasing fascia. 
You will explore the use of props as you allow the body to relax and let go of any stress and tension to feel fully supported in each pose. The workshop will also introduce the use of pranayama and meditation to take you deeper. 
Learning the differences between a yin and yang practice can help to better understand the benefits of a fully balanced practice.

Yin yoga is a quiet and meditative and uses long-held passive poses. Gentle poses are held for anywhere between 3-7 minutes with very little muscular engagement. 
This is a truly nourishing style of yoga that must be experienced in order to truly understand its benefits.

This workshop is open to all levels.
