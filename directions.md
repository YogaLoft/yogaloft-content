### Directions

The Yoga Loft is located right in the heart of Plymouth city centre above the old Cafe Rouge.

Our stairwell entrance is to the left of the old Caf√© entrance and just to the right of Vaughan's Hair Salon.

Within walking distance of the Rail and Bus stations and opposite the Plymouth City Centre Post Office at the Bretonside end of Royal Parade.

### Parking

There is a small car park and street parking just outside the Loft. Both are pay and display. It is usually easy to get a space for evening classes. Mid-day is occasionally challenging.

Parking wardens patrol regularly, including evenings so take care to get the correct amount of time on your ticket. You can also pay from your phone with the [ringgo app](https://www.myringgo.co.uk/apps).

There is some free parking available on [Lambhay Hill](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir//50.3667421,-4.1374174/@50.3665077,-4.1372833,19z) after 6pm. This is a short walk away (6 min).
