## Holly Manigan

In a class led by Holly Manigan, students should prepare to get to know themselves better. Fueled by an understanding of human anatomy and neuropsychology, Holly invites you to connect to your thoughts, to your breathe and to the movements of your body. She rarely demonstrates poses in hopes that you will listen to her offerings and embody them in a way that serves you. Inspired by traditional yoga, all of its eight limbs, Holly looks to keep things honest. She often reminds her students that the purpose of the physical practice is not to look a certain way in a posture, but it is to feel a certain way in a posture. She invites students to embrace their current state of being. Her classes focus on integrity, not only with movement but also with intention. Holly believes it is important to know yourself and to let that knowledge guide your choices, both on as well as off your mat.
 
When teaching, Holly draws on her education in Behavioral Neuroscience and from her experience as a NASM certified Personal Trainer. She completed her 200-hour RYT with Lynne Begier and Ame Wren, both of Boston Massachusetts, in 2012 and she continues to study with experienced teachers around the United States. Since leaving the medical industry, Holly has been continuously humbled by the joy her students bring to her life and she welcomes you to the journey that lies ahead.
