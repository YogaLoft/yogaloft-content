Gavin Tilstone

Gavin Tilstone has been practicing Iyengar Yoga since 1995 and teaching since 2006. Gavin holds the Introductory level 1 and 2 and Intermediate Junior Level 1, 2 and 3 teaching certificates awarded by IYAUK. He continues to train in the U.K. with pupils of BKS Iyengar and in India under the guidance of the Iyengar family.

BKS Iyengar was born in Bellur, South India in 1918 and started practicing yoga at the age of 16 under the guidance of his Yoga Master, Prof. T. Krishnamacharya. Through his discoveries and innovations, BKS Iyengar quickly established himself as the definitive authority on yoga, and today Iyengar Yoga has become the world’s most practiced method.

Iyengar Yoga is a dynamic form of exercise that strengthens and invigorates the body. Through alignment, timing and sequencing, it makes the body fit, the mind alert, whilst pacifying the brain.
