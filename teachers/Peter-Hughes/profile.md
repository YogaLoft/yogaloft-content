I have had a keen interest in mind and body unification for nearly 40 years - it has been an integral part of my study of Ki Aikido and Ki Development. In 2014 I discovered that many of the exercises and methods that I had been practising and teaching were derived from Japanese Yoga.

These methods were developed by Nakamura Tempu in Japan from the 1920s until his death in 1968 based on his experiences studying Yoga (predominantly Raja Yoga) with a teacher called Kaliappa in the Himalayas.

One of his most prominent students was Koichi Tohei. I attended a two week course with him in 1978 and trained in his system for nearly 10 years. This went on to form the basis of my practice ever since.

I am keen to share what I have learnt, and continue to learn, through these simple but profound methods.
