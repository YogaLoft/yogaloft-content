I began taking yoga classes in 2010 as a supplementary practise alongside training to be a professional dancer in London. Taking classes both in London and with fellow yoga loft teacher Charlotte Levy when home in Devon, yoga practise supported my dance training and was particularly helpful when recovering from a knee injury. Yoga became part of my daily practice once graduating with BA Hons degree in Contemporary Dance, maintaining this consistent practise alongside performing and teaching developed my interest to learn more about yoga. Following this I completed my yoga teacher training in Bali during August 2015.

I teach within a vinyasa flow style and offer a multi level class in order to cater for the participants in the room. Growing up I completed training in gymnastics, partner acrobatics and as a gymnastics coach, so this is something I like to incorporate into my classes where suitable.
