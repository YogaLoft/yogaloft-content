## Keef Wesolowski Miles

I have been exploring, practicing and teaching many approaches to conscious evolution for over 20 years now and along the way I have become a multi-certified Yoga/Movement Teacher and Body Worker. I am the founder of Prana Motion and a certified teacher of Movement Medicine. Essentially it is my innate passion for life, love and laughter; community, connection and creativity; words, humour and music; yoga, massage and dance that revitalizes my life every day and enlivens the work that I am called to share. I have been incredibly blessed on my journey to have been supported and guided my many wonderful teachers, friends and family and it is a profound, yet simple, honour to share with you as we explore together this curious dance we call being human. We are human beings, human becomings, human dancings.

I have studied widely in many different approaches to yoga, including Hatha, Vinyasa Flow, Anusara (1000+hours) and Integrative Yoga therapy. I regularly teach in London at TriYoga, The Life Centre and other yoga studios. I have a thorough grounding in anatomy, physiology, biomechanics and yoga therapy.
