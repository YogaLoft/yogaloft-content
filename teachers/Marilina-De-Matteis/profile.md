## Marilina De Matteis

My first approach to yoga was in 2009 with Bikram yoga when I was living in Madrid. I attended regular classes back then and I enjoyed it, but I felt there was something missing and a lot more I wanted to discover about yoga. In particular I was missing the creativity and the spirituality of it, which I soon found when I moved to the UK. When arrived in Plymouth I started to explore different styles of yoga at the Yoga Loft, and I finally found what I was looking for.

In 2014 I decided to start a new adventure and deepen my study: I enrolled for a 6 month Foundation Course with Duncan Hulin at the Devon School of Yoga, and last year, I started my YTT Diploma with Yogacampus in London.

I love learning from different teachers and incorporating their precious advice and knowledge in my daily practice.

Here I am starting my teaching practice now. I could't be happier and more grateful for all the people I met on my journey and the ones yet to come.

Yoga gives me joy, energy, happiness and peacefulness. My wish is to share my passion with you and I hope I will be able to transmit to you these beautiful sensations, as my teachers do with me.
