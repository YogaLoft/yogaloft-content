Most forms of yoga focus on the individual, an opportunity to go 'inside' both on a physical and emotional level. Acroyoga is about connection, trust and working together. In this class you may just surprise yourself and will have the opportunity to work with, support and be supported by others.

If you've already been to this class, we'd love to hear your thoughts on how it went. [Leave feedback](http://goo.gl/forms/W1SZ0defxC)
