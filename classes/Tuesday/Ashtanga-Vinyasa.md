Led Primary series; Lee is a dynamic and inspirational teacher and in this class you will be led through the asthanga primary series.

> Asthanga is a system of yoga transmitted to the modern world by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois (1915-2009). This method of yoga involves synchronizing the breath with a progressive series of posturesâ€”a process producing intense internal heat and a profuse, purifying sweat that detoxifies muscles and organs. The result is improved circulation, a light and strong body, and a calm mind.
