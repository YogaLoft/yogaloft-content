## One on one personal sessions

### Just you and your instructor with the space to yourself

We offer personal yoga training in dedicated one on one sessions to give you a tailored yoga session focussed on your specific needs. Whether you want to explore a particular muscle movement or just understand your body better, your teacher will focus on you alone and help you to develop your practice in a space where the ambience is all Yoga.

You can set the agenda by telling your instructor exactly what you want to achieve or you can ask them to create a session that targets areas you want to work on. These sessions are all about your needs.

### Booking

One on one sessions take a little planning. Here's how it works:

- Go ahead and book a session below for the time and date you are interested in. We need payment up front in order to start the process.
- If there's a time and date you have in mind, that isn't shown, email us at [info@yogaloft.co.uk](mailto:info@yogaloft.co.uk) and we'll do our best to accommodate.
- We will email you back to check if you have a specifc instructor in mind, you needn't wait to hear from us. If you prefer, you can go ahead and email [info@yogaloft.co.uk](mailto:info@yogaloft.co.uk) and let us know:
 - If you have a specific instructor or Yoga style in mind
 - Any special requirements
 - Any injuries, disabilities or medical condition your instructor should take into account in tailoring your session
- We'll set out to find you an instructor at the time you have requested and let you know as soon as it's confirmed.
- Show up and have both your instructor and the room all to yourself for the session. Enjoy!

### Rescheduling

Once your instructor has committed to the time and date of your booking, please try not to change it, if it can be helped.
If you do need to make a change and your booking is at least 7 days away, we will accommodate at no charge.
We'll start the process over to find an instructor available for your adjusted schedule.

If you are rescheduling on short notice and your booking is within 7 days, we will only be able to accomodate your request if your confirmed instructor is able to make the new appointment.

### Cancellation and refunds

Refunds are available when:

- Your booking is more than seven days away and you don't want to reschedule.
- We are unable to find an instructor to accommodate your booked time and date.
- We are unable to accommodate your special requirements.
