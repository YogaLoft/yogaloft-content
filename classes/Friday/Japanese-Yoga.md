Here are the elements that you will explore during our sessions:

### Stretching
Stretching is done in a relaxed and natural way with the emphasis on using the mind to extend the capabilities of the body. We use dynamic stretching which means movement continues throughout the stretch rather than holding a position.

### Ki Testing
Ki is the Japanese word for the energy produced by using the mind and body together. We use simple exercises and tests to feel the difference correct thinking makes to physical movements and postures. The feedback from these tests quickly lets us discover the correct 'feeling'.

### Breathing Methods
Our breathing methods will increase the depth, and slow the pace, of your breathing. This has been shown to have many health benefits - not least as an effective way of ‘destressing’ and reducing anxiety. Gradual progression and using the mind with the physical process are key features.

### Yodo Ho
A range of rythmic physical movements designed to get the mind and body working together with the focus on the lower abdomen. They are also a good exercise for the body - again building up gradually.

### Meditation
Two methods of meditation are practiced - one using the sound of bell, and one with a visual focus.

Initially learning to concentrate fully (akin to mindfulness) and then leading into the clarity of meditation (devoid of the ‘chatter’ of the conscious mind). This can be performed effectively sitting in a chair, as well as the more traditional lotus postures or Japanese sitting posture (seiza).

Here is the foundation of our study:

Four Principles for Unifying Mind and Body
- Use the mind in a positive way
- Train the mind to arrive at full concentration
- Exercise the body naturally
- Train the body gradually, systematically and continuously.
