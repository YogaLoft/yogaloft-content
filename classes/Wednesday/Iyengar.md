Iyengar Yoga is a dynamic form of exercise that strengthens and invigorates the body. Through alignment, timing and sequencing, it makes the body fit, the mind alert, whilst pacifying the brain.

The practice of Yoga Asanas (postures) and Pranayama (breathing techniques) has a very beneficial effect on the whole body. The joints and muscles are toned and strengthened. The circulation, digestion and breathing systems are stimulated, which improves their functions and assists the whole body to eliminate toxins. Energy levels are increased and the ability of the immune system to resist illness improves. Yoga is a holistic approach to good health, which encompasses mind, body and spirit. With the practice of yoga, negative feelings of doubt, fear and selfishness are naturally replaced by positive attitudes such as courage, faith and compassion.

The benefits of yoga include:

- Vitality
- A sense of well-being
- Increased flexibility
- Enhanced concentration
- Improved posture
- Strength
- Self-confidence
- Mental calm
- Spiritual direction
