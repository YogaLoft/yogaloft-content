My classes are carefully designed to promote wellness, developing strength and flexibility for all levels. You will experience gentle body opening movements connecting to the breath. The class then flows into a series of dynamic fluid movement sequences (Surya Namaskars) to create heat and release stagnation (energy blocks). Once the heat has been created, at the peak of the class, we practice some more challenging poses ; ‘Headstand’, ‘Wheel’, ‘Crow’, for example. For these ‘peak poses’ there are a series of Kramas ; small steps that build towards achieving the peak pose over time, when the mind and body are ready. This is a lot of fun. Having fun is also central to my practice. Counter poses and stretches then end the movement section (Asana) before we allow the body to absorb the benefits of the practice by resting (Savasana).

Music is an important part of my classes. My playlists include a range of chilled out sounds as well as more energising world beat music mixes.
