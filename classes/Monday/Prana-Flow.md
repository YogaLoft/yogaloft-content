Prana Motion Yoga is a powerful synergy of yoga, movement and meditation practices developed from 15 years of study and practice in a wide variety of ancient and contemporary practices: including yoga, dance, meditation, tantra, shamanism, body work and other approaches to life and conscious evolution.

It is both playful and prayerful in its approach to the dance of life. It is focused on connection, community, creativity and our relationships with each other and all of life. Its primary intentions include self-exploration, healing and creative, embodied and heart-centred self-expression; healthy relationships and the weaving of innovative, dynamic and sustainable communities and the ongoing revelation of the full potential of each human being as unique and interconnected and interdependent expressions of divine consciousness. So much is possible when we choose to plug in to Source and fully participate in the co-creation of our life stories.

We will explore a dynamic flowing yoga practice, some simple pranayama techniques, and a movement meditation. The first hour of the class will include practices on the mat. The last 3O minutes will be an exploration of yoga as a movement meditation practice.
