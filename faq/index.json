Socks interfere with your connection, and they can make it harder to balance. Neither you nor your teacher can see if your feet are properly aligned if they are hidden under socks, and you run the risk of injury from slipping if you wear them."

At busy classes in the evenings and on weekends, reception takes longer and sometimes the noise can interrupt the beginning of the yoga session. It's really helpful when people have prepaid and booked online and helps to keep disruption to a minimum. It makes check-in quick and painless.",
